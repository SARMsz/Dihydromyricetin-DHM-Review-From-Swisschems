<p>I’ve tried several liver‑support supplements, but Swisschems’ Dihydromyricetin (DHM) Powder stood out. I tested it over four weeks for hangover relief, recovery, and overall wellness. Here’s my honest take—from taste and mixability to effects on energy and clarity.</p>

<h2>What Is Dihydromyricetin (DHM) Powder?</h2>
<p>DHM is a natural flavonoid extracted from the Japanese raisin tree. It’s known for antioxidant and liver‑support benefits. Swisschems offers a pure, unflavored powder. No fillers, no fillers, just DHM. It dissolves in water, juice, or your favorite shake.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Purity check:</strong> I compared Swisschems’ 99% purity claim with lab reports from other brands.</li>
  <li><strong>Taste & mixability:</strong> I stirred 300 mg in water and noted any grit or aftertaste.</li>
  <li><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> I used 300 mg before bed after two social drinks and logged my morning energy, headache level, and nausea.</li>
  <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> I repeated the test on different nights and recorded average scores.</li>
  <li><strong>Side effects:</strong> I monitored digestion, sleep quality, and mood for any negatives.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<p>After the first dose, I noticed less morning grogginess. By week two, my headache score dropped from 6/10 to 2/10 on busy mornings. Energy felt steadier, and I didn’t need coffee until my usual afternoon slump. Mixing 300 mg in a glass of water was easy—no lumps, barely any taste.</p>
<p>On regular days (no alcohol), I tried DHM for antioxidant support. I felt sharper focus and milder post‑workout soreness. It seemed to help my liver recover faster after cheat meals or heavy protein shakes.</p>
